# Renaming Files with American-Style Dates to European-Style Dates
# you have thousands of files with American-style dates (MM-DD-YYYY) in their names and needs them renamed to European-style dates (DD-MM-YYYY)
"""
Hereâ€™s what the program does:
    It searches all the filenames in the current working directory for American-style dates.
    When one is found, it renames the file with the month and day swapped to make it European-style.

This means the code will need to do the following:
    Create a regex that can identify the text pattern of American-style dates.
    Call os.listdir() to find all the files in the working directory.
    Loop over each filename, using the regex to check whether it has a date.
    If it has a date, rename the file with shutil.move().
