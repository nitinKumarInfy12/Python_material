# An assertion is a sanity check to make sure your code isnâ€™t doing something obviously
# wrong. These sanity checks are performed by assert statements. If the sanity check fails,
# then an AssertionError exception is raised. This exception mus not be handled in through the ty-except block
# In code, an assert statement consists of the following:
# -The assert keyword
# -A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
# -A comma
# -A string to display when the condition is False

# Assertion can be disabled by using with the -O option
